            <p>A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of Your Computer. Some cookies may last only through a single website session or visit. Others' cookies may have an expiration date or may remain on Your Computer until You delete them.

            <p>A web beacon is a small graphic image or other web programming code that may be included in our Services and messages. A web beacon may be invisible, but any electronic image or other web programming code can act as a web beacon.
